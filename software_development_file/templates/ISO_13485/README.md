A single markdown file cannot substitute for a manufacturer's actual ISO 13485 quality management
system — that system spans document control, management review, resource management, and much more
that lives in a manufacturer's own QMS tooling, not in a software repository. This file exists to
state explicitly, for whoever reads this `software_development_file/`, **which pieces of this
product's engineering scaffolding intentionally support a QMS process, and which the manufacturer's
own QMS must still supply.**

## What this product's engineering artifacts can feed into your QMS

> `ISO 13485:2016 §4.2 Documentation requirements` and `ISO 13485:2016 §7.3 Design and development`

[ List: e.g. requirement/verification traceability records, generated build evidence, ADR trail —
whichever of these your own build actually produces, with file paths. ]

## What your QMS must still supply

[ List: e.g. management review records, CAPA process, supplier evaluation, complaint handling,
regulatory reporting — i.e. everything ISO 13485 requires that is not a software engineering
artifact. ]
